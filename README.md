# Welcome to Evasion!

You play as a **turtle** trying to evade an angry **triangle**, all the while grabbing **cash**. You have **three tries** to get as much cash as possible before the **triangle** gets you. But be careful! Every time it passes, it takes 100 **cash** away from you! How long can you survive for? And how much **cash** can you salvage?
